## About

In this game, I made a basic tile placing app. The initial code was created from my friend Ananth, but most of the code was altered to accomodate for panning and multiple sprite placing.

## DragonRuby

To create this game, I utilized the game engine DragonRuby. DragonRuby is an incredibly powerful game development engine that provides simplicity without taking away functionality. For more information, pleaes visit the following link:
